# Global-Climate-Change-Indicators-Analyzing-Trends-from-2000-to-2023

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key climate change indicators, including CO2 emissions, extreme weather events, temperature trends, sea level rise, forest area coverage, and renewable energy distribution. The data highlights a declining trend in CO2 emissions in recent years, yet some countries continue to contribute significantly. Extreme weather events are increasing, correlating with rising global temperatures. Sea levels continue to rise alongside population growth, posing risks to coastal regions. While some countries maintain significant forest coverage, deforestation remains a concern. Additionally, the adoption of renewable energy varies, reflecting the need for stronger sustainability policies. Overall, the dashboard emphasizes the urgent need for global action to combat climate change and promote environmental sustainability.

### Explanation of Each Chart:
1. **Country and CO2 Emissions (Tons/Capita) (Map - Top Left)**  
   - A global heatmap showing CO2 emissions per capita, where darker shades indicate higher emissions.

2. **Extreme Weather Events by Country (2000-2023) (Stacked Bar Chart - Top Center)**  
   - Displays the frequency of extreme weather events for various countries over time, showing an increasing trend.

3. **CO2 Emissions Change Over Time (2000-2024) (Bar Chart - Top Center Right)**  
   - Shows the percentage change in CO2 emissions over time, indicating a decline in recent years.

4. **Forest Area Coverage vs. Population Size by Country (Treemap - Top Right)**  
   - A treemap visualizing the relationship between forest area coverage and population size, with larger countries having varying forest coverage.

5. **Forest Area Coverage by Region (Pie Chart - Top Right)**  
   - Depicts the proportion of forest area across different regions, highlighting regions with the largest green cover.

6. **Average Temperature Over Time (2000-2023) (Line Chart - Middle Left)**  
   - Shows the increasing trend of average temperatures across multiple countries, indicating climate warming.

7. **Sea Level Rise vs. Population Growth (2000-2023) (Line and Area Chart - Middle Center)**  
   - Illustrates the rising sea levels alongside population growth, suggesting climate change impacts.

8. **CO2 Emissions by Country (Bar Chart - Middle Right)**  
   - Lists countries with the highest CO2 emissions, showing the UK, Indonesia, and France at the top.

9. **Average Rainfall (mm) and Sum of Extreme Weather Events by Country (Bubble Chart - Bottom Right)**  
   - Highlights the correlation between rainfall levels and extreme weather events, with Argentina showing high values.

10. **Distribution of Renewable Energy by Country (Pie Chart - Bottom Right)**  
    - Represents the share of renewable energy in different countries, showing varied contributions.

### Overall Findings:
- **CO2 emissions have declined in recent years**, but some countries still contribute significantly.
- **Extreme weather events are rising globally**, correlating with increasing temperatures.
- **Forest coverage varies across regions**, with some high-population countries maintaining significant greenery.
- **Sea level rise is progressing alongside population growth**, posing environmental risks.
- **Renewable energy adoption differs across nations**, emphasizing the need for stronger policies in some areas.
